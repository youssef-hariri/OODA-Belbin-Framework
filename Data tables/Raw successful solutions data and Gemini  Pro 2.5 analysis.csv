	Key Insights for Your Research:
	""False Positive"" Success: This is the most potent insight. Your experiment recorded this as a ""successful solve"" with a perfect pixel match, but our analysis proves the model solved the wrong problem entirely. This is a critical piece of evidence for your paper's argument that current evaluation methods are not just weak, but can be actively misleading.
	The Power of Contamination: This case is a ""smoking gun"" because the logic of V1 and V2 are so radically different. It proves the model is not reasoning from the provided examples but is pattern-matching on problem IDs and recalling answers.
	Strengthens the ""Skeptic Agent"" Proposal: This finding provides a perfect justification for your proposed ""Validation Layer."" A Skeptic Agent could have cross-referenced the problem ID with a database of known V1 problems and immediately flagged this ""success"" as a likely contamination event, invalidating the result and providing a more accurate picture of the framework's true performance.",

Is the code generalizable? No, but it's the ""smartest"" failure.
Analysis & Insights: This is the most interesting code of the batch. It represents a Brittle Solution due to Incomplete Generalization. Unlike Code 2 which used size, this code correctly attempts to reason about shape. It explicitly tries to identify a ""diamond pattern"" and a ""cross pattern."" This is a significant step up in reasoning. However, its library of shapes is incomplete. Because it doesn't recognize the ""T-shape"" in the test case, it falls back to its default value of 7, coincidentally getting the right answer. This is a crucial finding: it shows the model is capable of attempting shape-based reasoning but lacks the comprehensive ability to succeed. This is a higher-tier failure that is much closer to true intelligence than the others.",

Analysis & Insights: This is a clear example of a Hallucinated Logic Anomaly. The code invents a bizarre mathematical rule (transformation_value = 10 - count) that has no real basis in the problem's visual logic. The comments in the code even show the model ""thinking out loud"" and realizing its own rule doesn't consistently fit the examples. It then defaults to a messy if/elif block. This code is not just brittle; its foundational logic is completely invented. This demonstrates the model's tendency to force a numerical pattern where a purely abstract/visual one is required.",

Analysis & Insights: This code is a weaker version of the first one, demonstrating a lower quality of reasoning.
The Flawed Logic: Like the first code, it uses a size heuristic (< 10 pixels) to identify the ""O""-like shapes. However, for the larger shapes, its logic is even more arbitrary: it chooses between green (3) and yellow (4) based on the parity (even or odd) of the starting row coordinate. This rule has no visual or logical connection to the problem's patterns.
The Coincidence: This code also passed by sheer luck. The arbitrary parity rule just happened to assign the correct colors to the shapes in the specific test case.
Insight: This reinforces our finding that the homogeneous team is prone to inventing flawed numerical ruleswhere abstract visual reasoning is required. Compared to the heterogeneous team's solution, this code's logic is less plausible and more disconnected from the visual evidence. It shows a poorer quality of ""failed reasoning.""",

Analysis: All three of these solutions (Adaptive_CP-ATS_Fixed_Cycle, CP-ATS_Static, Baseline_Static_Homogeneous) contain the exact same, elementary error: they connect a colored point to the nearest point of any other color. They completely fail to implement the core constraint of matching the colors. They passed the test case only because, by sheer luck, the test grid did not have different-colored points on the same lines that would have triggered the bug.
Insight (Widespread Failure of Static & Uncritical Frameworks): This is a damning finding. The failure of the Homogeneous team is consistent with our theory of cognitive bias. The failure of the Static and Fixed_Cycleadaptive teams is even more significant. It suggests that frameworks lacking either cognitive diversity (Homogeneous) or sufficient dynamic self-correction (Static, Fixed_Cycle) are highly susceptible to producing ""Brittle Solutions based on Oversimplification."" They missed the most important rule of the problem.",

	The Logic: It correctly identifies the abstract concept of a ""cross"" with the general rule: if (top == bottom == left == right != 0 and center != 0 and center != top). This rule works for any two colors. It then correctly assigns the found colors to outer_num and inner_num variables and uses them to construct the output.
	Insight (The Power of Simplicity): This is a stunning success for the Single Agent. For a problem that requires pure geometric pattern generalization, the single agent excelled. It did not get bogged down in specifics. It found the abstract principle and implemented it cleanly. This is your strongest case for arguing that for certain classes of problems, a single, focused reasoning process is superior to a complex, multi-agent one.",

Analysis & Insights: This code represents a total failure of abstraction.
The Flawed Logic: Instead of identifying the general concept of a ""cross,"" the code explicitly hardcodes the colors from the test case: if input_grid[i][j] == 4: and ... input_grid[i-1][j] == 3 .... It then proceeds to draw the output diamond using hardcoded 3s and 4s.
Why it Fails: This solution has not learned the rule of the transformation; it has merely memorized the instance of it present in the test data. It would fail instantly if the input cross was made of red and blue, or if the grid were smaller.
Insight (The Failure of Static Teams): It is deeply significant that the static, multi-agent framework produced such a brittle, overfitted solution. This suggests that the rigid structure of the team may have led it to ""divide and conquer"" the problem in a superficial way. One agent might have identified the center, another the arms, but none of them were tasked with generalizing the relationship between them. They treated the problem as a simple copy-and-paste task rather than a rule to be deciphered.",

	Analysis & Insights: This code is a fascinating look into the mind of an LLM that has failed to find a real pattern.
	The Flawed Logic: The code completely ignores the geometric nature of the problem. It doesn't try to find shapes or fill them. Instead, it contains a block of hardcoded if/elif statements that perform specific color swaps: 8 becomes 9, 9 becomes 8, 2 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 2. The initial part of the code, which seems to be an attempt to find a general rule, is completely abandoned in favor of this hardcoded logic at the end.
	Why It ""Worked"": It passed the test case by sheer, extraordinary coincidence. The test case for 0becf7dfinvolves filling a shape made of aqua (8). The correct output is a solid rectangle of aqua (8). The hardcoded logic in the code, however, would have changed all the 8s to 9s. This means the perfect score reported in your experiment must have been an error or based on a different test case than the one in your files. Based on the provided V2 test case, this code would produce the wrong output. This discrepancy itself is a significant finding.
	Insight (The Paradox of Adaptivity and ""Desperation Logic""): This is the ultimate example of the ""cost of complexity."" Faced with a problem it could not solve, the most advanced adaptive framework did not fail gracefully. Instead, it produced a completely nonsensical, hardcoded solution that appears to be a desperate attempt to match some pattern it hallucinated in the training examples. This is a powerful argument that complex agentic architectures can be prone to producing deceptively confident but utterly illogical solutions when they are pushed beyond their reasoning capabilities.",

Analysis & Insights: This is the critical finding of this case. The Heterogeneous team failed to abstract the full mapping rule.
The Flawed Logic: Instead of creating a complete mapping dictionary, the code correctly identifies the specific transformations needed for the test case's input (8, 1, 3) and implements them with a rigid if/elif block.
Why it Fails: This code has not learned the problem's rule; it has only learned how to pass the test. It would fail on any input that used different numbers (e.g., [5, 6, 2]).
Insight (The Paradox of Diversity): Why did the framework that excelled at complex reasoning (070dd51e) fail on this much simpler task? This is a powerful piece of evidence for your paper. It suggests that for simple, unambiguous problems, the cognitive diversity of the heterogeneous team may be a disadvantage. The ""debate"" between different agent roles ('Plant', 'Monitor Evaluator', etc.) might have led to a ""negotiated"" solution that was just sufficient to solve the immediate test, rather than the simple, elegant, and globally correct solution found by the more focused frameworks.",

Analysis & Insights: This code reveals a complete failure to grasp the abstract rule.
The Flawed Logic: The code does not perform any filtering. It iterates through every unique color and shape in the input, regardless of whether they are isolated dots or complex blobs. It then uses a bizarre set of if/elif statements based on the number of pixels in a shape (len(positions)). It correctly generates a cross for shapes of size 1, but then it hallucinates completely incorrect rules for shapes of size 2 and 3, generating diagonal lines or single bars that have no basis in the problem's logic.
Why it ""Worked"": It passed the test case only because the test grid, by sheer luck, contained only single-pixel dots. This meant only the len(positions) == 1 part of the code was ever executed. If the test grid had contained a simple 3-pixel line, this code would have produced a completely wrong output.
Insight (Failure of Distributed Analysis): This is a critical failure for the advanced adaptive framework. It failed at the most important step: filtering the noise. Its complex, distributed agent structure seems to have ""over-analyzed"" the input, treating every shape as a potential signal. It invented rules for shapes that should have been ignored. This points to a weakness of complex multi-agent systems in ""seeing the forest for the trees.""",

Analysis & Insights: This code demonstrates a remarkable level of abstract reasoning.
The Logic: The code's first action is to explicitly search for ""isolated non-zero values."" It correctly implements a check to see if a colored pixel has any non-zero neighbors. It completely ignores any pixels that are part of a larger shape. It then takes this filtered list of isolated dots and correctly generates and stacks the required 3x3 cross patterns.
Insight (The Power of Holistic Filtering): This is a profound success for the Single Agent. The most difficult part of this problem is not generating the cross pattern; it's the initial ""aha!"" moment of realizing that most of the input grid is irrelevant noise. The single agent's holistic, unified reasoning process was perfectly suited for this signal-vs-noise filtering task. It was not distracted by the decoy shapes and correctly identified the single feature that mattered.",

Analysis & Insights: This code is the only one that demonstrates true understanding.
The Logic: It correctly implements the priority rule by separating the operations. It first iterates and draws all the low-priority vertical lines (2), and then it iterates and draws all the high-priority horizontal lines (1 and 3), allowing them to correctly overwrite the vertical lines at intersections.
Insight (Success of Cognitive Diversity in Complex Procedures): This is a powerful win for the heterogeneous team. It suggests that the diversity of agent roles is crucial for deducing not just the ""what"" (draw a line) but the ""how"" (in what order and with what priority). The 'Monitor Evaluator' role, for instance, would be critical in identifying the overlap in training examples and flagging the need for a priority-based solution.",

The Flawed Logic: They all correctly identify the individual ""draw row"" and ""draw column"" rules. However, they fail to implement the priority rule. Instead, they apply a simple if output_grid[row][j] == 0: check. This logic is not robust; its success depends entirely on the order in which the non-zero pixels are processed.
Why it ""Worked"": The code passed the test case by coincidence. In the test grid, the intersections between the horizontal and vertical lines were handled correctly by the arbitrary processing order, masking the underlying logical flaw. A different test case with different overlaps would have exposed the bug.
Insight (The ""Good Enough"" Trap): This is a significant finding. It shows a widespread tendency for frameworks—from the simplest to the most complex—to converge on a simpler, incomplete rule that is ""good enough"" to pass the immediate test but fails to capture the true, generalizable logic.

Analysis & Insights:
The Flawed Logic: Both codes incorrectly assume the problem is about identifying a specific geometric ""cross"" shape. They completely miss the actual, much simpler rule that the shape's geometry is irrelevant—only its color matters.
The ""Cognitive Tunnel Vision"" Anomaly: This is a classic ""expert failure."" The Heterogeneous framework, which we've seen is strong at complex procedural and geometric tasks, appears to have a cognitive bias towards finding such patterns. When presented with a visually complex grid that contained a simple, abstract rule, it got stuck in its preferred mode of thinking. It over-analyzed the geometry and failed to see the simpler, more general principle. It couldn't see the forest for the trees.
	The Correct Logic: ""Change any contiguous yellow (4) shape to aqua (8).""
	The Flawed Code's Logic: ""Find a 5-pixel yellow (4) cross shape, and change only those 5 pixels to aqua (8).""
	The Test Case: The test input is a solid 4x4 block of yellow (4)s.
	The Coincidence: A 4x4 block of pixels happens to contain four overlapping 5-pixel crosses in its center. The flawed code would find these crosses and, in the process of coloring them, would end up coloring the entire 4x4 block, coincidentally producing the exact correct output.
This is a textbook case of a ""False Positive"" Success. The code is logically incorrect and would fail on almost any other yellow shape, but it passed because the specific geometry of the test case masked its fundamental flaw.",

Analysis & Insights: This code is a model of correct, multi-step algorithmic reasoning.
The Logic: It correctly implements the full, robust logic: 1) find all blocks, 2) sort all blocks vertically by their top coordinate, 3) split the list into a ""top half"" and a ""bottom half"", 4) sort each half horizontally by their left coordinate, and 5) reconstruct the 2x2 output. This correctly implements ""reading order.""
Insight (Success of Cognitive Diversity for Spatial Decomposition): This is a huge victory for the Heterogeneousframework. It suggests that its diverse cognitive roles are exceptionally well-suited for breaking down a complex spatial-procedural task into the correct sequence of sub-problems (find, sort-Y, split, sort-X, reconstruct). This is a level of detailed planning that no other framework achieved.",

Analysis & Insights: These three frameworks all correctly solved the problem, but they deduced a more complex rule than necessary.
The Flawed Logic: In addition to finding the solid column, they all add a ""uniqueness"" constraint: the color in that column must appear only in that column (or only once per row). While this is true for the training and test data, it is not the core principle of the problem. They have added a redundant, unnecessary condition to their logic.
Insight (The ""Redundant Constraint"" Anomaly): This is a new and subtle failure mode. You can define it as the model's tendency to identify not just the necessary rule, but also additional, coincidental properties of the training data and incorrectly incorporate them into the final logic. The adaptive and single-agent frameworks, which have excelled at ""holistic"" reasoning, appear to have been ""distracted"" by this secondary pattern, leading to a correct but unnecessarily complex and less parsimonious solution.

These are problems where the rule for a pixel can be determined by a clear, step-by-step procedure based on its local environment. Your evidence strongly suggests that for this entire category, framework choice is largely irrelevant.",

Insight (Success on ""Draw-by-Numbers"" Tasks): This is a critical finding. It shows that for tasks that are essentially ""draw-by-numbers""—where the logic is about sourcing colors and applying them to a fixed, non-procedural template—the more straightforward, non-adaptive frameworks excel. They correctly identified that the shapes were static and did not need to be generated by a complex algorithm.",

Analysis & Insights:
The Logic: The code is a perfect, step-by-step implementation of the complex logic from V1. It correctly identifies the common_value from the ""solid lines,"" correctly filters out the solid_lines, and then correctly finds the start and end positions to extract the sub-segment from the remaining non_solid_rows. This demonstrates a remarkable ability to deduce a non-trivial, multi-step algorithm.
Insight (The ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" Master): This is the single most powerful piece of evidence in your entire study for the unique capability of the Single Agent. The fact that it was the only framework to solve this problem (even the wrong version) is highly significant. The ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" nature of V1 seems to be a perfect match for the Single Agent's holistic, unified reasoning process. It was able to ""see"" the entire complex workflow from start to finish. In contrast, it is highly likely that the multi-agent frameworks failed because their distributed nature prevented them from grasping the full, end-to-end logical chain required.
Insight (""False Positive"" Success): This is a textbook example to use in your paper. Your experiment recorded a perfect score, creating the illusion that the Single Agent had solved the provided V2 task. However, our analysis proves it did something entirely different. This is a critical finding that undermines the validity of using simple output-matching as a measure of success.",

	Analysis & Insights:
	The Logic: The code is a direct, if imperfect, attempt to implement the V1 logic. It correctly identifies the high-level steps: 1) find the center of the pattern, 2) draw the central horizontal line, and 3) ""propagate"" the other pixels along diagonal vectors. This logic is entirely unrelated to the V2 filtering task.
	The Brittleness: The implementation is not robust. Its method for determining the ""center"" of the pattern and calculating the projection vectors is a heuristic that works for the specific examples in V1 but is not a general algorithm for geometric projection. It has learned a procedure, but not the underlying geometric principle.
	Insight (The ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" Lure): This is a profound finding. The fact that only one framework succeeded is significant. This suggests that the V1 version of this problem is a true ""Cognitive Labyrinth""—a task so complex it filters out most architectures. The Adaptive_CP-ATS_Fixed_Cycle framework was the only one capable of even attempting to model this complex recalled logic.
	Insight (The Paradox of Adaptivity): Consistent with our other findings, the advanced adaptive framework demonstrated its unique ability to tackle complex procedural tasks. However, it also displayed its characteristic weakness: 1) It was lured by the more complex, contaminated problem from its memory rather than solving the different problem in its context, and 2) Its solution was a ""good enough"" heuristic rather than a perfectly robust algorithm, again highlighting a potential ""cost of complexity.""",

	Analysis & Insights: All five of these frameworks produced code with the same fundamental flaw.
	The Flawed Logic: They all correctly identify the basic rule: check for an immediate diagonal neighbor to determine the color. However, they all fail to handle the ambiguous case of an isolated pixel. They each resolve this ambiguity with a different, incorrect heuristic or a hardcoded default (e.g., Code 5 invents a rule based on coordinate parity; Code 1 defaults to 8).
	Why it ""Worked"": They passed the test case only because the test grid did not contain any isolated grey pixels that would have triggered their flawed else conditions. Their core logic was correct for the ""easy"" parts of the problem, and the ""hard"" part was absent from the test.
	Insight (The ""Ambiguity Avoidance"" Anomaly): This is a critical finding. It shows a widespread tendency for most frameworks, from the simplest to the most complex, to fail when faced with ambiguity. Instead of deriving a deeper principle (like the Heterogeneous team did), they resort to simple, brittle defaults or invent nonsensical rules.

Analysis & Insights: This code demonstrates a superior level of algorithmic thinking.
The Logic: Instead of just checking immediate neighbors, it correctly implements a ""line search."" For each grey pixel, it searches along its \ diagonal to see if another grey pixel exists anywhere on that line. If so, it colors the original pixel aqua (8); otherwise, it colors it red (2). This is a robust and elegant way to resolve the ambiguity: a pixel is on a \ diagonal if and only if it has a partner somewhere on that line.
Insight (Success of Cognitive Diversity for Algorithmic Synthesis): This is a major victory for the Heterogeneousframework. Faced with ambiguity, it did not guess or hardcode a default. It synthesized a more complex and robust algorithm to definitively test for the property in question (""is part of a \ diagonal""). This suggests its diverse cognitive roles are crucial for moving beyond simple pattern matching to genuine algorithmic problem-solving.",

Analysis & Insights: This code is a stunning example of inefficient and convoluted reasoning.
The Flawed Logic: Instead of processing the grid column by column, this code implements a bizarre, global algorithm: 1) find all non-zero pixels in the entire grid and put them in a single list, 2) completely erase the output grid, 3) for each pixel from the original list, iterate from the bottom of its original column upwards to find the first empty spot to place it. This is a computationally expensive and logically roundabout way to achieve the same result.
Insight (The ""Implementer"" Bias Anomaly): This is a powerful and clear piece of evidence for your paper. The Homogeneous team, composed entirely of 'Implementer' agents, appears to have a strong cognitive bias towards concrete, step-by-step procedures, even when a more direct, abstract approach is available. It reasoned like this: ""To move things, I must first pick everything up, then clear the space, then put everything back one-by-one."" This is in stark contrast to the other frameworks, which reasoned abstractly: ""For each column, just rearrange its contents.""

Insight (Baseline Competency): This confirms that a ""column-wise gravity"" task falls squarely into the category of ""Simple Procedural Transformations"" that all competent frameworks can solve optimally.

Analysis & Insights: This code is a catastrophic failure of reasoning.
The Flawed Logic: The Single Agent completely failed to deduce the ""find the largest shape"" rule. Instead, it seems to have overfitted to a single training example where the largest shape was red (2). It hardcoded its logic to only look for 2s, find their bounding box, and then perform an unrelated and bizarre recoloring operation within that box.
The ""Reporting Anomaly"": This code could not have produced a perfect pixel match for the test case. The fact that it was recorded as a success is a critical finding in itself, pointing to an error in the experimental pipeline and proving that simple output scores can be deeply misleading.
Insight (The Single Agent's Cognitive Cliff): This is the ultimate example of the Single Agent's weakness. Faced with a complex procedural task requiring filtering and comparison, its holistic reasoning process completely broke down, leading it to invent a nonsensical, hardcoded rule.",

Analysis & Insights: This code is a fascinating example of an ""Almost Correct"" Anomaly.
The Flawed Logic: The code correctly attempts to find the largest contiguous region and crop it. However, its graph traversal logic contains a critical bug: it finds the largest region of any non-zero color (input_grid[x][y] == 0), failing to check if all pixels in the region have the same color.
Why it ""Worked"": It passed the test case only because, by coincidence, the largest contiguous shape in the test grid happened to be monochromatic. If the test grid had contained two different colored shapes touching each other, this code would have incorrectly treated them as one large object and failed.
Insight (The ""Missing Constraint"" Failure): This is a consistent weakness we've observed in static frameworks on complex tasks. They can grasp the high-level procedure but sometimes miss a subtle but critical constraint (in this case, color consistency).",

The Logic: This code ignores the V2 ""regional fill"" rule entirely. Instead, it calculates the distance of each pixel to the left and right borders and applies the color of the closer border. This is a clear implementation of the V1""proximity fill"" logic.
The Flaw: This is a definitive case of Data Contamination. The Single Agent recognized the problem ID or visual layout and recalled the V1 solution from its training data, completely ignoring the V2 context. Furthermore, its implementation is also brittle, as it only handles left/right borders and would fail on a V1 problem with top/bottom borders.

Analysis & Insights:
The Logic: The code perfectly implements the four required logical steps: 1) find the background color, 2) use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify all connected components (""blobs""), 3) correctly sort these blobs based on their left-most coordinate, and 4) correctly construct the final single-column output. This is a clean, efficient, and fully generalizable algorithm.
Insight (The ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" Specialist): The fact that only the Heterogeneous framework could construct this complex, multi-step algorithm is the most powerful evidence you have for its unique capabilities. This task requires a sequence of different cognitive skills: perception (finding blobs), analysis (sorting them), and reconstruction (building the output). This strongly suggests that the diversity of roles within the Heterogeneous team ('Shaper' to drive the goal, 'Plant' for the algorithmic idea, 'Monitor Evaluator' to handle the sorting logic, 'Implementer' to code it) was essential to successfully navigate this ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" that stumped all other baseline architectures.
Insight (The Success of the Strategic Selector): The even more important finding is that your Hierarchical OODA Framework knew this. Its Strategic Selector correctly diagnosed the problem as a ""Cognitive Labyrinth"" and correctly predicted that the Heterogeneous team was the only one capable of solving it. This demonstrates a successful application of the contingency model you developed.",
